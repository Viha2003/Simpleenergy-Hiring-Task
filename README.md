# Battery Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze battery performance and predict the Effective State of Charge (SOC) using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes multiple features related to battery voltage, current, temperature, and other relevant metrics.

## Contents
- `project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning model development.
- `model.py`: Python script for the model implementation and evaluation.
- `dataset.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis and model training.

## Objectives
- To explore relationships between battery features and the Effective SOC.
- To develop machine learning models to accurately predict Effective SOC.
- To generate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to battery performance.

## Machine Learning Models Used
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Gradient Boosting**
5. **Support Vector Regressor**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors**

Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The following KPIs are calculated to provide insights into battery performance:
- Charge Cycle
- Range
- Battery Performance
